AKA - My programming beliefs. The right way to program according to me.


Just like different writers have different writing styles, different programmers have different programming styles.
By style, I mean a set of preferences and the way they approach writing programs. Over the years, I have developed
my own style and I will describe it below. It's not entirely original. A lot of it are concepts I have seen elsewhere
but like they said, great artists steal.

* Classes are for abstract data types.
* Avoid class methods
* No staticmethods, use functions instead
* Inheritance is not a mechanism for code reuse
* Immutable by default
* Pure functions
* Avoid cyclic dependencies
* Dependency Injection over importing
* The laws of demeter should apply to modules too.
* Use modules like this
* No dynamic creation of variables
* Mocking is a code smell
* Test pyramid - unittest should be fast
* Test private functions if they are complex enough
* Domain Driven Design all things
* Code should be in layers
* Dont throw away useful work
* Generic programming ftw
